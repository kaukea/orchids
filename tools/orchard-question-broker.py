"""Token-free question-popup broker (sidebar-polish item 12c-f).

An agent asks a question over the bus (`bus.py ask`); this script — a plain
long-running process, never an agent, never spending a token — is what makes
that ask() actually reach the operator and come back with an answer:

    watch loop -> finds a new question broadcast (tools/bus.py's
    _question_envelope, scanned via tools/sidebar_model.py's own bus-root
    resolution, never a re-derived traversal) -> waits until the operator is
    not mid-input (12e) -> pops a native `tmux display-popup` over the
    operator's CURRENT window (12c) -> reads keypresses, accepting ONLY the
    defined option keys, no default/dismiss/timeout (12d) -> sends the
    answer back over the bus to the asking session (`bus.py send
    --in-reply-to`).

None of this is parameterizable by the asking agent (12f): `bus.py ask` has
no flag that skips deferral or widens the accepted keys — those rules live
entirely here.

Design split (mirrors tools/sidebar.py's render_lines()/curses split): every
decision is a pure function taking plain data — match_option_key(),
is_operator_busy(), pending_questions() — unit-testable with no tty, no
tmux, no live process. Only main()/_handle_question()/the tmux/termios calls
below them are I/O and need a live tmux session to exercise for real; that
part is NOT covered by tests/test_orchard_question_broker.py and needs a
human/live check (see the step's report).

ASSUMPTIONS flagged for the operator (this trial's HOW decisions):
  - "operator's current window" is resolved via the most recently active
    attached tmux CLIENT (`tmux list-clients`), then that client's current
    window — the best fleet-wide proxy available; a single-operator,
    possibly-multi-client tmux server is assumed.
  - "recent activity" (the idle fallback for typing outside a claude
    session, 12e) is tmux's own `client_activity` — updated on every
    keystroke sent to the server, independent of the harness. There is no
    per-keystroke Claude Code hook; the harness only exposes UserPromptSubmit
    (fires on SEND, not while typing), which is used here as the "just
    submitted, safe now" signal that overrides mere recency of pane activity
    for one instant, per is_operator_busy()'s docstring.
  - `bus.py ask` itself has no timeout (blocks until answered) — the
    no-timeout-auto-pick rule (12d) is about the POPUP's keypress handling,
    not about how long an agent's ask() may block.

    LETTER begins capturing a line buffer (see the ch.isalpha() gate in
