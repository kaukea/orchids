"""Cross-repo bus reader/aggregator for the fleet sidebar.

READ-ONLY observer over the on-disk bus (see tools/bus.py, message.schema.json):

    <git-common-dir>/the-works/bus/<session-id>/<datetime>.json

one JSON message per file. This module never deletes, moves, or otherwise
mutates a bus file — messages are owned by their recipients (bus.py's
`receive` drains them on the way up); the sidebar only looks.

ATTRIBUTION: the folder a message physically sits in is its RECIPIENT's inbox,
not its origin — bus.py's fan_out/broadcast delivers a copy into every OTHER
session's folder, never the sender's own (`peers = [... d.name != sender]`).
So every message is attributed to its envelope `from` field, never to the
folder it was found in: a repo's bus is scanned in full (every session
folder), and each parsed message is routed to state[from].

EPHEMERALITY: a message file disappears once its recipient's bus sidecar
drains it (`receive` unlinks on read), often within moments. A sender's
last-known activity/lifecycle/subagent-set must therefore be remembered
across scans, not just re-derived from whatever happens to be on disk right
now — see _BusAggregator, which accumulates per-sender state keyed by
envelope `from`, deduplicated by envelope `id`, applied in `ts` order
(last-write-wins per field). `build_model()` is a single-scan convenience
wrapper around a fresh, throwaway aggregator; `watch()` keeps one aggregator
alive for the life of the watch so accumulation survives across scans.

Repo list resolution (sidebar-polish item 7a, "dynamic appearance" — see
resolve_repos()): primary discovery is the orchard registry
(tools/orchard_registry.py, ~/.config/orchids/sidebar-registry.json) —
installing orchids in a repo (`.ai.toml` presence) IS registration, no
hand-kept list required day to day. ORCHIDS_SIDEBAR_REPOS survives as an
explicit, optional override for manual/debug use: when set, it names a
repolist file (one repo path per line, '#' comments and blank lines ignored)
read verbatim, registry and hiding bypassed. Falls back to the current repo
alone if the registry resolves nothing.
