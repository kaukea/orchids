> One operating model for every repository — agents, skills, and rules as a single versioned package.

**Tired of every repo teaching its agents different habits?** Left alone, each
project grows its own workflow: agents improvise roles, skills drift out of
sync, rules live in one CLAUDE.md and not the next, and everything an agent
learned evaporates when the conversation ends. orchids packages the whole
operating model — who the agents are, what they know, what rules bind them —
versioned in one place and delivered identically to every repository you own.

## Five agents, one assembly line

You talk to the **orchestrator** — it knows the board, reads your mood, and
suggests what's worth doing next. It never writes a line of code.

While you think, the **ripener** keeps the backlog sharp: every parked task
gets researched, scoped, and questioned before you ever pick it up, so nothing
starts cold.

Say go, and an **architect** takes ONE feature into its own worktree. It
explores read-only, agrees a plan with you, and touches nothing until you say
**MAKE IT SO**. No surprise diffs, no "while I was in there".

The architect fans the build out to **builders** — headless workers that each
take one tight step and hand back a diff with its own test result.

And when you say it's done, the **housekeeper** runs the close: docs verified,
tagged, squash-merged, pushed, cleaned up. The same close, every single time.

Nothing lives in chat. Scope, findings, decisions, progress — all of it is
files in the repo, so any agent picks up cold exactly where the last one
stopped.

One more agent isn't on the line at all. Every session quietly loads a **bus** —
a sidecar that lets independent agents in the same repository talk to each other,
so the orchestrator can hold a live picture of who is running, how far along they
are, and how much context they have left before they need handing over. You'll
see it as a `messages · …` line in your pane. You never address agents yourself;
it's how they reach each other, not you.

## Skills: the knowledge that travels with you

Fix a lesson once, and every repo knows it on the next sync.

**Discipline that holds.** The `workflow` and `workflow-complete` pair enforce
the gates — feature branches, agreed testing, your explicit approval, an
identical close. `git-commit` makes history readable, `clean-code` keeps the
output short and honest, `readme-sync` stops this very file from lying, and
`diagnostics` turns "it's broken" into one reproducible script instead of an
hour of flailing.

**House rules for your stacks.** `coding-dotnet`, `coding-tofu`, and
`coding-lmstudio` carry the conventions for .NET, OpenTofu, and local-LLM
work; `shortcut-file` reads and writes Apple Shortcuts at the byte level;
`software-catalog` knows the apt dependency rule that once nuked a desktop —
so no agent repeats it.

**A forensics lab, ready to open.** Evidence handling with a command-level
`chain-of-custody`, full `forensic-acquisition` to signed E01 images,
`read-apfs` for encrypted Apple volumes on Linux, `machine-access` for locked
Macs without lowering their defences, `icloud` rescue before data is lost,
`reverse-engineering-files` for opaque formats, `digital-signature` for
smart-card-sealed manifests, and `write-to-s3` for tamper-evident off-site
storage.

**And the model's own machinery.** Skills that keep the agents honest
(`read-agents`, `agent-behaviour`), pass work between sessions without leaking
chatter into history (`handover`), ripen the board (`ripen-tasks`, `orchestrator`),
migrate a grown-wild repo into the canonical shape (`history-rewrite`), and
teach agents to write new skills properly (`authoring-skills`).

**Upgrades that catch every repo up.** When the package moves or reshapes a
managed file, it ships a dated entry in `migrations/` — state-guarded
instructions any agent applies in one pass, prompted by a hook the moment a
repo is behind. A repo that skipped ten upgrades converges the same way as one
that skipped one; the highest migration date IS the package version. Every
session keeps a small rolling log in `.git/the-works/` — physically
uncommittable, shared across worktrees — so a reset or an agent swap never
loses the thread: the successor reads the stream's logs and continues. And
when the ask is just a typo fix, the agent offers a single commit on `main`
instead of the full branch ceremony — you say yes, it stays micro.

**The board follows you off the terminal.** Active tasks mirror to GitHub
issues and the private **Orchidarium** project view; file an issue from your
phone and an actor-gated workflow folds it back into the file board before the
next session even starts (`tools/board_gh.py` — files stay canonical, GitHub
is the couch-friendly view).

**And the pipeline itself rides GitHub too.** On the package repo the same
spine runs on issue comments (`cloud-path` workflow): the feature is an issue,
and your comments are the gates — `ENGAGE`/⚙ kicks off the plan, `MAKE IT
SO`/🖖 builds and opens the PR, `THAT IS ALL`/🚪 sends the housekeeper to
squash-merge it. Only your comments count, and no gate ever approves itself.

## What it is not

orchids is **data only** — no code, no installer. Distribution is
[kauk](https://github.com/serialseb/kauk)'s job: bootstrap any repo by telling
your agent **"install kauk/orchids"** — it resolves the repo on GitHub and
follows [`Agent-installation.md`](Agent-installation.md).
