# Clean code

Boundaries to keep agents from doing what they do best: spaghetti, one hundred lines
at a time. Per-language skills (`coding-*`) add stack specifics on top.

## Checklist

- [ ] Methods are short — one responsibility each
- [ ] No comments — the code is self-descriptive (names carry the intent)
- [ ] Components compose behind a shared interface instead of imperatively calling the next one
- [ ] No duplication (DRY) — extracted, not copy-pasted
- [ ] SOLID respected — especially single responsibility and dependency direction
- [ ] Functional style where it fits — composable, not dogmatically pure

## Rules

- **Short methods.** A method that needs scrolling is several methods.
- **No comments; self-descriptive code.** If a comment feels needed, rename or
  restructure until it isn't. (Constraint-comments the code cannot express are the
  rare exception.)
- **Prefer composition sharing the same interface** over one component imperatively
  calling the next — pipelines of interchangeable parts, not call-chains welded
  together.
- **DRY.** The second copy is the moment to extract.
- **SOLID principles** — as also stated in `AGENTS.shared.md`; they bind every edit,
  not just new design.
- **Functional style — composable, not pure.** Favour small transformations that
  chain; don't contort the code for purity's sake.
