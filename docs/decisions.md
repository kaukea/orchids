## [2026-07-16] Decision-001: History migration is an orchestrator charter, gated by the AGENTS.md `repository:` field
#history-rewrite #orchestrator #repository #orchids #gitflow #migration #subagent #parallel

**Context:** No role owned the `history-rewrite` skill — the orchestrator's
direct-on-main carve-out covered only the workflow component, and the architect's
scope is one feature sidecar, not every ref. Operator ruling (2026-07-16).

**Decision:**
- The orchestrator charters history migration — the one repo-wide surgery in its
  domain. No architect: the scope is the whole ref graph, not a feature.
- **Applicability gate:** the project `AGENTS.md` declares `repository:`. Only
  `orchids` (the canonical workflow shape; missing/empty counts as `orchids`) is
  eligible. Any other value (e.g. `repository: gitflow`) means the repo keeps its
  own branching model — agents never restructure its history.
- **Parallel prep, gated writes:** the skill's §0–§1 (sensitive sweep + partition
  proposal) are read-only and run as a background subagent while the orchestrator
  keeps working the board. All writes (§2+) wait behind operator gate #1; the
  partition, QES, and swap gates remain operator-only.

**Touched:** `agents/orchestrator.md` (new History-migration section),
`skills/history-rewrite/SKILL.md` (applicability gate + dispatch note),
`templates/AGENTS.md` (`repository:` convention).

## [2026-07-17 11:02 CEST] Decision-002: Delivery is driven by a task-oriented role DAG declared in the definitions
#roles #taxonomy #delivery #frontmatter #manifest #kauk #sync #context-economy #install

**Context:** Every session in every repo loads all 26 skill descriptions (~10.2 KB)
whether or not the work is relevant. `manifest.conf` already carries a `role` field
(`dev|infra|org|all`), but it is **inert**: kauk's `resolve_mode` (`bin/kauk:41-56`)
reads it only as a section name to look up in `.ai.toml`, never as a filter, and no
`.ai.toml` in the fleet defines a role section — so all 26 skills link everywhere.
Agents are worse: plain `link` lines, installed unconditionally with no identity.
Operator ruling (2026-07-17).

**Decision:**
- **Roles are task-oriented, never job titles** — `development`, not `developer`.
  Follows SFIA 9 (activity-noun categories) and NICE/NIST SP 800-181, which renamed
  its whole vocabulary in 2023 explicitly "to avoid being mistaken for job titles".
- **Authors declare the role, in the skill/agent definition's frontmatter** — not in a
  central table. The author of a skill knows what it is for; `manifest.conf`'s role
  field is retired as the home for this.
- **Roles form a DAG, not a flat list.** Nodes nest (`security` → `forensics`); a
  definition may declare several paths (`coding-tofu` is genuinely both
  `development/tofu` and `infrastructure/tofu`). A flat list forces false choices and
  presents one specific process as universal.
- **Selection installs the chosen node's subtree**, plus its ancestors' own skills.
  A node with children is selectable as the coarse pick.
- **Agents become first-class and may declare required skills** — a dependency the
  package can state, rather than an assumption (e.g. the workflow needs the groomer).
- **The HOW is kauk's, not orchids'.** orchids ships the vocabulary, the declarations
  and the dependency edges; the reader, the install-time picker, and the filter are
  kauk's. orchids is data-only, so this work lands as data even while kauk ignores it.
- **The vocabulary must not preclude unbuilt siblings** (e.g. a `process/kanban` beside
  `process/workflow`). Not built now; not designed out either.

## [2026-07-17 11:02 CEST] Decision-003: The orchids role vocabulary
#roles #taxonomy #vocabulary #sync #forensics #workflow #general #process #security

**Context:** The concrete node list implementing Decision-002, decided against the
existing 26 skills. Supersedes nothing — `dev|infra|org|all` was never a decision,
just an artifact (kauk's auto-adoption stamps every adopted skill `dev`,
`bin/kauk:272`). Operator ruling (2026-07-17).

**Decision:** the node list is

```
general            read-agents · agent-behaviour · authoring-skills ·
                   git (generic half)
process
  └ workflow       workflow · workflow-complete · handover · groom ·
                   orchestrator · history-rewrite · readme-sync ·
                   git (workflow-specific half)
  └ (kanban)       reserved sibling slot — unbuilt, must stay expressible
development        clean-code · diagnostics
  └ dotnet         coding-dotnet
  └ tofu *         coding-tofu
  └ lmstudio       coding-lmstudio
  └ file-formats   shortcut-file · reverse-engineering-files *
infrastructure     software-catalog
  └ tofu *         coding-tofu
security           digital-signature
  └ forensics      chain-of-custody · forensic-acquisition · read-apfs ·
                   machine-access · icloud · reverse-engineering-files *
```

`*` = multi-parent (the DAG rule, Decision-002).

Rulings embedded in the above, each a choice among live alternatives:
- **`general` is not `core`.** "Core" implies mandatory, which is what smuggled one
  specific process into every repo. What is actually universal is ~700 bytes.
- **The workflow is a child of `process`, not a universal.** `handover`, `readme-sync`,
  `workflow-complete` and the `Branch:`/main-immutable git rules are *our* process, and
  a repo running a different one must be able to decline them.
- **`security` is the node; `forensics` is its child.** Matches SFIA, which files
  `Digital forensics (DGFS)` under Security services. We do not promote a leaf to a
  root. `digital-signature` sits at `security` — signing is not forensics-only.
- **`infrastructure`, not `operations`.** The corpus is IaC/provisioning and contains
  zero run-it-in-production skills. The two names overlap badly; pick one. (Noted:
  `infrastructure` is industry vernacular — Spotify, GitLab — not SFIA/NICE vocabulary.)
- **`git` splits** — generic hygiene (gitmoji, subject/body limits, scope discipline)
  is `general`; the `Branch:` trailer, main-immutable, and the MAKE IT SO gates are
  `process/workflow`.
- **`doing-skills` is renamed `authoring-skills` and sits in `general`.**

**Open, deliberately not ruled here:** `write-to-s3`'s placement. Provisionally
`security/forensics`, but the operator flagged it as likely carrying private
information that must not be published — a publication question, not a taxonomy one.
See TODO `pre-publication-cleanup`.

**Gap noted, not fixed:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` has no Taxonomy table, though
`AGENTS.files.md` §TODO requires `functionality`/`component` to draw from it and
`board_lint.py` lints `value ∈ glossary`. The board's `publication` / `process` /
`sync` values are de facto only.

## [2026-07-17 14:36 CEST] Decision-004: Agent dependencies — agent→agent edges are declared, in a `requirements:` map
#agents #dependencies #frontmatter #role-delivery #install-flow #kauk

Two rulings, closing `agents-first-class`'s last open questions:

- **Agents declare dependencies on other agents**, not just on skills. The real graph
  has these edges (the orchestrator hands to architect/housekeeper/groomer; the
  architect dispatches builder), and an undeclared edge deploys a broken agent.
  Consequence for the two-page install flow: page 1 greys out agents required by a
  chosen agent, exactly as page 2 greys out required skills — the pull-in is legible,
  never silent.
- **The declaration is a `requirements:` frontmatter map with two sub-lists**, kinds
  explicit:

      requirements:
        agents: [builder]
        skills: [workflow, workflow-complete, handover]

  Chosen over a flat mixed list (would need a cross-folder uniqueness rule) and over
  typed ids (`agent:builder` — noisier). The map form takes a third sub-list later
  without disturbing these two — how `agent-external-deps` stays unprecluded while
  deferred.

Context, not ruling: the `roles:` key remains `role-dag-frontmatter`'s to settle; the
dependency contract no longer waits on it. The resolution/greying engine is kauk's
`agent-deployment`.

## [2026-07-17 14:49 CEST] Decision-005: Roles declare as slash-path placements; `general` is explicit
#roles #frontmatter #role-delivery #skills #agents #kauk #taxonomy

Three rulings, closing `role-dag-frontmatter`'s questions:

- **Key + syntax:** `roles:` is a list of slash-separated full paths —
  `roles: [development/tofu, infrastructure/tofu]`. Rejected: bare node ids
  (ancestry invisible at the declaration site), nested YAML and `role:` + `parent:`
  pairs (tree edges copied into every declarer).
- **Paths are placements.** A declared path is a deliberate placement, and a
  multi-parent node may be placed under a subset of its parents —
  `roles: [development/tofu]` alone is valid, making per-route delivery expressible.
  Lint verifies each declared path exists in the vocabulary; an incomplete set is
  intent, not an error class.
- **`general` is explicit** (`roles: [general]`). A missing `roles:` key is a lint
  error — "forgot to declare" is never readable as "deliberately general".

Context, not ruling: the vocabulary stays declared in exactly one place
(Decision-002/003). The sidecar's "one round with kauk before committing" was waived
by ruling directly; kauk's reader implements this contract as written.

## ~~[2026-07-17 15:08 CEST] Decision-006: Architect sessions live in panes; the close returns to a pane~~
> Superseded by Decision-036 (window per architect; subagents hidden by default, peekable into right-column panes).
#tmux #workflow #architect #handoff #orchestrator #panes

Three rulings on the dispatch machinery, after the first live dispatch landed on a
window when the operator had asked for pane-level behaviour:

- **Agent sessions spawn as PANES, not windows** — the architect splits from the
  orchestrator's own pane, so the build runs next to the conversation that dispatched
  it.
- **The close handshake is pane-scoped.** `.return-window` line 1 carries a pane id
  (`%N`); the Stop hook lands the operator on exactly that pane, then kills the
  architect's pane. Legacy window ids (`@N`) remain honoured. Window-scoped return
  was insufficient the moment a window held more than one pane.
- **The spawn carries the initial prompt.** A fresh `claude` session waits silently
  for its first message; a trigger the operator must remember to type is a trigger
  forgotten. The spawn line is `claude --agent architect 'Boot: …'`.

Context, not ruling: the workflow machinery (agent defs, hooks, this contract) is
authored only by the orchestrator, directly on `main` — Decision-065's existing
ownership rule, restated at the operator's request after the pane requirement failed
to survive as conversation memory. Requirements about the machinery belong in the
agent def and this file, nowhere else.

## [2026-07-17 16:02 CEST] Decision-007: Agents hold a standing write-right over linked package files
#kauk #symlinks #permissions #skills #settings #workflow

The harness refuses Edit/Write through a symlink ("Refusing to write through
symlink"), and no setting exists to change that (verified against current Claude
Code documentation, 2026-07-17). The kauk skill's "edit at the path you loaded it
from, never chase the target" is therefore unexecutable as written. Operator ruling:

- **Agents are authorised — and required — to write linked package files by
  resolving the symlink and writing the target** in
  `.ai/repositories/<owner>/<repo>/`. That is kauk's local-edit surface; `kauk sync`
  reconciles (commit → rebase → push back). In the package's OWN repo, mirror the
  change to the real source files (repo root) in the same turn, or run `kauk sync`
  so checkout and source converge — never leave the two divergent.
- **The refusal is a harness limitation, not a policy signal.** It is not a "no";
  agents do not stop or re-ask on it. The operator's permission here is standing.
- **The fleet `settings.json` ships allow rules** — `Edit(.ai/repositories/**)` and
  `Write(.ai/repositories/**)` — so the resolved-path write is neither denied nor
  prompted, and (via permission-rule merge into the sandbox writable paths) not
  sandbox-blocked either.

Follow-up owed upstream: amend the kauk skill text (pull-only, lives in
serialseb/kauk) — see TODO `kauk-skill-symlink-write`.

## [2026-07-18 18:34 CEST] Decision-008: Transients live in .git/the-works/; structural changes ship dated migrations
#the-works #handover #mood #migrations #watermark #git #hooks

Two rulings from the-works workstream:

- **The uncommittable channel is namespaced.** `HANDOVER.md`, `MOOD.md`, and the
  migration watermark live in `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/the-works/` — same
  guarantees as the former flat `.git/` placement (physically uncommittable,
  worktree-shared), plus an identity that cannot collide with git's own files or
  other tooling. Writers `mkdir -p` the directory.
- **Every structural change to a managed artifact ships a migration.** One dated,
  state-guarded file in the package's `migrations/` (format:
  `AGENTS.files.md` §Migrations), in the same branch as the change. The package
  version IS the highest migration filename; a per-clone watermark
  (`.git/the-works/migrated`) plus a `settings.json` hook announce pending entries;
  the agent merges all pending migrations and applies the net effect once.
  Historical entries may be backdated to the change they describe — a repo that
  never had the package converges by running the whole series, no fresh-install
  special case.

Context, not ruling: skills describe only the current world; legacy-conversion
clauses belong in migrations, never in skill text.

## [2026-07-18 18:36 CEST] Decision-009: Cross-repo writes are gated, surface-bound, and never the suggested route
#kauk #permissions #settings #cross-repo #skills #agents #symlinks

Narrows Decision-007's third ruling (the blanket `Edit/Write(.ai/repositories/**)`
allow rules). Decision-007's other rulings stand: the resolve-the-symlink write
procedure remains the sanctioned mechanism, and the harness symlink refusal remains
a limitation, not a policy signal. Three rules, by strength:

- **Hard gate.** No standing write-right over `.ai/repositories/**` as a whole.
  Because `kauk sync` pushes package edits back upstream, a clone write is a
  cross-repository change propagating fleet-wide — the harness permission prompt is
  the authorization gate, per occasion, not standing.
- **Surface boundary.** The fleet `settings.json` allows frictionless writes only
  inside a package's content surfaces: `agents/`, `skills/`, `files/` (the
  direct-into-repo symlink folder — the rule attaches to the folder, whatever it
  holds). Machinery (`manifest.conf`, `settings.json`, `hooks/`, `tools/`, `bin/`)
  is never writable from a consuming repo; machinery changes happen only in the
  package's own repo, through its own workflow.
- **Reasoning norm.** An agent avoids even SUGGESTING edits to a repository it is
  not working from: capture the issue (TODO naming the source repo, or report to
  the operator) and let the fix ride the source repo's workflow (`agent-behaviour`
  skill). Decision-007's write-through path is used only on explicit operator
  direction.

## [2026-07-18 18:39 CEST] Decision-010: Micro-tasks may ride main, offered by the agent, gated by the operator
#workflow #micro-task #main #commits #branching

A one-commit triviality (typo, prose fix, one-line config value) does not earn the
full workflow machinery. The agent, judging a task micro — single commit, no design
choice, no meaningful testing question — OFFERS a direct commit on `main` up front;
the operator's acceptance IS the existing direct-commit override. The agent never
self-selects the path, and promotes to a full workflow the moment scope grows (a
landed micro-commit stays on `main`; the grown scope starts fresh). Such commits
carry `Branch: main` — the sole exception to the git-commit trailer rule.

## [2026-07-18 19:10 CEST] Decision-011: Per-session workstream logs replace the handover; promotion is the ingester's
#the-works #workstream-log #handover #session #reset #relay #single-writer #todo #decisions

Supersedes the monolithic `HANDOVER.md` mechanics (the channel location rulings in
Decision-008 stand; this changes what lives there). Rulings:

- **Every session keeps its OWN rolling log** in `.git/the-works/<stream>/`
  (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<role>.md`): State (rewritten in place), Findings, Dead ends,
  Decisions pending promotion, Pointers — written as work happens, never
  reconstructed at the end. One file per session; a session never edits another's;
  a stream reads oldest→newest. This makes a reset or agent change
  non-destructive: the successor reads the stream and continues.
- **Single-writer on main's docs.** The board (`TODO`) and `docs/decisions.md` are
  written only by the orchestrator / top-level session. Children stage rulings in
  their log's "Decisions (pending promotion)"; the ingester promotes them. A
  top-level session (no parent) self-promotes at its own close.
- **Ingest = promote → archive.** A `_closed` stream (marker file, announced by
  the shared hook) is read, promoted, then MOVED to `.git/the-works/_ingested/` —
  PROVISIONALLY retained, not deleted: commit messages and the changelog already
  carry the positive record, but dead ends and failures have no committed home;
  a few weeks of use decide whether that archive earns its keep (follow-up task
  `ingested-retention`).

## [2026-07-18 20:28 CEST] Decision-012: orchids publishes at the renamed aihelp repo; org lands on kaukea
#github #origin #remote #org #kaukea #aihelp #publish

The repo's GitHub home is the former `SafeKeepIt/aihelp`, renamed to
`orchids` — chosen over creating a fresh repo so the dotai-sync era
stays attached. Its history was grafted in via an `ours` merge
(unrelated histories, tree untouched): every aihelp file was a
superseded May–June draft, so nothing was content-merged. Public
visibility retained (kauk clones unauthenticated by default).

Org naming: `kauk.ai` is impossible (GitHub names can't contain dots,
one case-insensitive namespace) and `kaukai` — settled on kauk's board
— turned out to be held by a dormant 2022 user account, as is `kauk`
(release ticket filed). Ruling: the org name is **kaukea** (6 letters,
kauk-kin), picked from a 409-name availability sweep. The operator
creates the org in the web UI (no API exists); the repo then transfers
`SafeKeepIt` → `kaukea`, with GitHub redirects covering both the
rename and the transfer. Dormant-release requests for `kauk`/`kaukai`
may still upgrade the name later; a rename from `kaukea` redirects.

## [2026-07-18 22:55 CEST] Decision-013: Private until scrubbed — the publish gate is real
#github #visibility #publication #scrub #leak #kaukea #board

Amends the visibility clause of Decision-012 (its repo-home and org rulings
stand): kaukea/orchids and serialseb/kauk are PRIVATE, effective immediately.
Tonight's public window (~2.5h, full history, forensic skills included) is
treated as a leak per the operator. Re-publicizing anything requires, in
order: the pre-publication-cleanup public/private split, a history scrub of
whatever surface goes public, and an explicit operator go. The
pre-publication-cleanup push gate applies to visibility changes exactly as to
pushes; no future session flips a repo public as a side effect of another
task.

## [2026-07-19 20:15 CEST] Decision-014: An agent's address is its session id
#message-bus #identity #session-id #agents #bus

Agent identity is `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, read from the environment. The first
draft derived it from the working directory — a linked worktree became its feature
id, the main checkout became `orch`. That ignored the environment, which already
publishes the answer, and collided for any two sessions sharing a location: the
orchestrator and a groomer both resolved to `orch` and would have drained each
other's mail.

Role (`CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT`) and worktree stay SEPARATE fields rather than being
folded into the address. A session id is unique but not guessable; a role name is
guessable but not unique. Conflating them yields something that is neither, and a
session-derived suffix on a name destroys the very property that makes an address
an address.

The creator learns the created agent's address because the created agent announces
it, naming its parent — flow is one-way, creator to created, so every edge of the
tree is known without a lookup service. `--session-id` can also mint one at launch
if a creator needs to know before first contact.

A subagent inherits its parent's environment verbatim (session id, role, PID —
verified). That is load-bearing, not a defect: it is what lets a bus sidecar
resolve to its PARENT's mailbox without being told who its parent is.

## [2026-07-19 20:15 CEST] Decision-015: Only top-level sessions sit on the bus
#message-bus #agents #subagents #scope

Bus membership is top-level sessions only. Subagents are the responsibility of the
agent that spawned them and already have `SendMessage` for talking to their owner;
they get no inbox and no address.

This dissolves the identity problem for sessions that have no stable name of their
own — several concurrent builders under one architect share no distinguishing role,
so naming them needed either a session-derived suffix (unguessable, therefore not an
address) or a per-task name (bookkeeping for a case nobody needs). Neither is built.

## [2026-07-19 20:15 CEST] Decision-016: No delivery guarantee, by design
#message-bus #delivery #reliability #bus

The bus offers no acknowledgement, no retry, no timeout and no redelivery. Messages
are deleted on consumption; a session's inbox is destroyed at SessionEnd along with
anything still unread.

A sending agent must expect never to receive an answer and decide for itself whether
to retry, abandon, or error. This is deliberate and pre-existing: building acks would
mean claim-then-delete, in-flight state, and a scheduler for timeouts — a broker,
which is exactly what the filesystem is being used to avoid.

Consequence accepted: a sidecar that dies between draining and handing up loses those
messages silently. The mitigation is not redelivery, it is that a requester notices
its own silence.

## [2026-07-19 20:15 CEST] Decision-017: The hook is the mechanism, not secrecy
#message-bus #hooks #sessionstart #sessionend #gate

Bus membership is established by SessionStart and SessionEnd hooks rather than by
instructions in agent prompts. Code does not drift; models do, and AGENTS.md and
CLAUDE.md get bypassed regularly. A hook applies to every agent in every flow,
including ones that never read their briefing.

The first draft claimed the session id was "withheld and returned by the bus — a gate
rather than a nudge", so an agent skipping its bus could not address anything. That
claim is false and has been removed: the id is an environment variable any agent can
read. What the design actually provides is DETECTION, not prevention — an agent that
never announces is visibly absent to every peer, so a skipped bus is discoverable
rather than silently deaf.

Loading the sidecar remains a model action, because a hook cannot spawn a subagent.
That is the acknowledged soft spot, accepted until the broader injection-integrity
problem is addressed.

## [2026-07-19 20:15 CEST] Decision-018: Identity is broadcast, status is asked for
#message-bus #identity #status #tokens #orchid #request-response

Immutable facts are broadcast once at load (`orchid:identity`): session id, agent
type, worktree, feature id, parent session. Mutable state is pulled on demand
(`orchid:status`): state, context occupancy, token spend.

Both logical requests are answered BY THE SIDECAR, off the parent's transcript, which
it can read because it shares the parent's session id. The parent is never woken, so
the exchange costs it no context — and status keeps answering while the parent is
busy, wedged, or mid-compaction. A parent that has never reported yields `unknown`
rather than silence, so a stalled agent stays distinguishable from a deaf one.

Token counts serve two consumers with near-identical payloads: an agent watching
context occupancy (its own death condition — context exhaustion degrades quietly
rather than failing loudly) and an operator watching spend. The four token classes
are carried broken out, never summed, because they bill at different rates and a
single total cannot yield cost.

Model and effort are deliberately NOT in identity: they can change mid-session (a
model disengaging, tokens running out), so identity-at-birth and status-at-time
would disagree. Adding them needs a rule for which wins, so they are parked rather
than half-built. Without a model there is no denominator, so counts ship raw and the
reader interprets.

`--visible` marks a payload the SENDING agent intends the user to see. It is about
agent-to-user surfacing through an agent-to-agent channel, and is unrelated to
whether operators address agents by name (they do not).

## [2026-07-20 01:44 CEST] Decision-019: Per-role model and effort are pinned in agent-def frontmatter; the orchestrator scales the architect by complexity
#workflow #agents #model #effort #frontmatter #orchestrator #tiering

Every agent def carries a `model:` and `effort:` YAML default, replacing the stale
generic tier names (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) with concrete current IDs. Registered
(operator, 2026-07-20):

- orchestrator — `claude-fable-5`, effort `high`
- architect — `claude-opus-4-8`, effort `xhigh` (the pegged default)
- builder — `claude-sonnet-5`, effort `high`; jobs are short-lived by design
- groomer — `claude-sonnet-5`, effort `low`
- housekeeper — `claude-haiku-4-5`, effort `low`
- bus (and the other pure-mechanism subagents) — `claude-haiku-4-5`, effort `low`

The architect's model is NOT fixed: the orchestrator scales it from the sized
complexity at handoff — up to `claude-fable-5` for the hardest long-horizon builds
(Fable pricing exceeds Opus-tier, so it is a per-task escalation, never the default),
the `claude-opus-4-8` peg for ordinary features, or down to `claude-sonnet-5` for
genuinely simple mechanical work. Effort scales on the same read. The frontmatter
value is the floor the override starts from; the orchestrator states any deviation
and gets operator agreement before launching. This heuristic lives in the
orchestrator definition. Sibling of Decision-018 / [[agent-metadata]], which surfaces
model+effort on the BUS at runtime — this pins the role DEFAULTS in the definition, a
different layer.

## [2026-07-20 19:45 CEST] Decision-020: Roles validation belongs to kauk; vocabulary referenced, never restated
#roles #frontmatter #lint #validation #kauk #taxonomy #authoring-skills

The role-dag-frontmatter lint (its Proposal item 3) is dropped from scope.
kauk's reader validates `roles:` when it consumes them — an orchids-side lint
over hand-authored declarations is circular, and placing enforcement in the
authoring skill is wrong because that skill is not the vocabulary's source of
truth. The vocabulary stays in Decision-003 and the frontmatter contract
REFERENCES it; no second vocabulary artifact is created in orchids. Follow-up
boarded ([[kauk-validate-roles]]): a `kauk package validate` stub now, real
taxonomy validation in kauk later.

## [2026-07-20 19:45 CEST] Decision-021: The authoring-skills rename rides role-dag-frontmatter
#skills #rename #authoring-skills #doing-skills #sequencing #roles

`doing-skills` -> `authoring-skills` is executed inside the role-dag-frontmatter
workstream at operator direction ("rewrite to the new name at the same time")
instead of waiting for skill-renames-and-splits. That task's rename item is
thereby done; its remaining scope is the splits (git-commit et al.) and any
further renames. Context: lands with the f/role-dag-frontmatter squash-merge.

## [2026-07-20 19:45 CEST] Decision-022: write-to-s3 is placed at security/forensics
#roles #write-to-s3 #taxonomy #forensics #publication

`write-to-s3` declares `roles: [security/forensics]`, adopting Decision-003's
provisional placement as the declared value (the lint-era "needs a value"
question dissolves with Decision-020, but the placement ruling stands). The
publication question (pre-publication-cleanup) is unchanged.

## [2026-07-20 20:10 CEST] Decision-023: The close parallelises and verifies by presence
#close #housekeeper #orchestrator #workflow #performance #delegation

Two speed rulings on the close (operator, 2026-07-20, after a 15-minute close
on a docs-only feature):

1. On "close it" the orchestrator dispatches the housekeeper IN THE BACKGROUND
   and PREPARES the stream ingestion while it runs — but commits nothing to
   `main` until the housekeeper returns: two writers on `main` mid-merge is a
   race, and an uncommitted tree trips the housekeeper's clean-tree step.
2. The housekeeper verifies the close-gate by PRESENCE (named commits, files,
   sections in the branch tip), deep-reading only reported skips or failed
   checks; a failed check is the proven gap it fills and flags.

A third proposal — moving the `completed:`/`completed_during:` header fill to
the architect's close-gate — is REJECTED for now: the operator does not
currently trust the architect (it does not dispatch builders as contracted;
see the architect-delegation task). Re-evaluate when that is fixed.

## [2026-07-20 20:44 CEST] Decision-024: Orchard is the fleet workbench; the cross-repo bus keeps its own name
#orchard #naming #cross-repo #workbench #fleet

The codename **Orchard** now means the fleet workbench: the cross-repository
view, selection and dispatch UX the operator specified 2026-07-20 (global
overview of every repository's prepared work, counts of pressing/broken/
blocked issues, cross-repo dependencies, session-per-repo launch). Orchard
PRESENTS ONLY what each repository's orchestrator has already prepared — it
never derives or re-triages.

The live cross-repository messaging previously carried under the Orchard name
moves to its own task id, [[cross-repo-bus]], scope unchanged. References to
"orchard" in older docs (e.g. the message-bus sidecar) should be read as the
workbench programme from this date.

## [2026-07-20 21:35 CEST] Decision-025: The handover contract — the sidecar is the WHAT, the HOW is the architect's, delegation is mandatory above s
#handover #architect #orchestrator #delegation #sidecar #what-how #questions #cloud

Operator rulings (2026-07-20), the contract behind [[handover-contract]]:

1. **WHAT/HOW split.** The sidecar carries the complete WHAT — feature
   definition, scope, constraints, relationships, and the operator's scope
   answers. The orchestrator owns getting it complete. The HOW — discovery and
   technical design — is the ARCHITECT's job (that is the role), presented at
   the plan gate and frozen by MAKE IT SO; it is never required handoff
   content. (Amends the former §Sidecar wording "Proposal is the HOW the
   architect runs".)
2. **Two question rounds, not a ping-pong.** Scope (WHAT) questions are put to
   the operator while the task is parked in the readiness pipeline; the spawn
   itself carries only the LAUNCH round — model/effort scaling (Decision-019)
   and the parallel-launch offer. When several RELATED features are in play,
   ONE scope round defines the WHAT across all (or the chosen subset) before
   ANY architect launches, cloud or local. An open scope question at launch
   means the handoff broke; a mid-build scope question pauses the build and
   goes through the orchestrator, it is not asked ad hoc.
3. **Delegation is mandatory above s-size.** An architect build above s-size
   MUST dispatch builders; zero builders fails the close gate. An s-sized
   feature may be built inline, stated and justified in the close report. The
   former "directly or via parallel builders" permission was the bug
   (absorbed architect-delegation task). Restores the trust condition behind
   Decision-023's deferred header-fill move.

The cloud consequence: an autonomous/cloud architect has no mid-flight
operator contact, so rounds one and two are its hard precondition —
[[cloud-architect]] builds on this contract.

## [2026-07-20 21:50 CEST] Decision-026: The groom word family is banned; the role vocabulary is ripen/ripener
#vocabulary #naming #ripen #skills #agents #readiness

Operator rulings (2026-07-20): the word family "groom"/"grooming"/"groomer" is
FORBIDDEN in all output and all artifacts — it relates to bad people in other
contexts. The replacement vocabulary is **ripen/ripener**, matching the orchard
metaphor: tasks RIPEN through the readiness pipeline until pickable; the
prep-only agent is the RIPENER; the skill is `ripen`. The rename of the skill,
the agent, and the verb across the corpus executes under
[[retire-groom-vocabulary]] with its §Migrations entry; until it lands, the old
artifact names are quoted only when technically necessary.

## [2026-07-20 21:59 CEST] Decision-027: The pipeline is orchestrator → ripener → architect; cloud rides issues and PRs, starting now
#pipeline #ripener #architect #orchestrator #cloud #scope #questions #deviance #handover

Refines Decision-025 (operator, 2026-07-20):

- The ORCHESTRATOR holds the high-level WHAT: what a feature does, what it
  replaces, what it allows, why it exists at all. Intake questions are asked
  before a task reaches the board proper.
- The RIPENER is a specific agent BETWEEN orchestrator and architect. It
  CLOSES the functionality scope with targeted questions on functional
  completeness; loose ends are left as explicit VOLUNTARY deferrals, never
  silent gaps. It decides by a statistical-probability criterion (see
  [[psychometric-discovery]]) that the scope is well enough defined for the
  architect to do its job, then KICKS THE ARCHITECT OFF AUTOMATICALLY.
- The ARCHITECT formulates the TECH plan: if it has real questions it asks
  them; if not it presents the architectural plan. File- and class-level
  changes are NOT pre-decided — that is what git and refactoring are for.
  The last question is a SUMMARY of the work → MAKE IT SO → build (local) /
  pull request (cloud).
- Question economy is the design direction: as the system refines, better
  questions upstream, fewer or none downstream. Today's gates exist because
  of existing behaviour (the error rate), not as permanent shape — they
  shrink as upstream improves.
- CLOUD HAS NO BLOCKER and does not wait: a new feature is a GitHub issue;
  the orchestrator's and ripener's rounds run as comments on the issue (or a
  discussion — either); MAKE IT SO → pull request; THAT IS ALL → housekeeper
  (worktrees locally; PR amends + merge in cloud). Waiting delays discovering
  the deviance in the system — start now. Amends this afternoon's "parked"
  note on [[cloud-architect]].

## [2026-07-21 01:57 CEST] Decision-028: The close is bus-driven — lifecycle signals replace the finishing hooks
#bus #lifecycle #close #choreography #hooks #teardown #liveness #metadata #status #tmux

Shipped by [[hook-choreography]] (operator plan-gate rulings, 2026-07-20/21):

- Lifecycle signal on the bus: `bus.py signal --state <started|building|testing|done|finished|blocked|abandoned>`,
  body `{kind: lifecycle, state, feature_id}`; directed to `ORCHID_PARENT_SESSION`
  when known and live, else broadcast. The parent session id is wired into the
  environment at architect spawn.
- The close rides the signals: the architect signals `done` at its gate and
  `finished` at the ALL IT IS countersign; the orchestrator acts on `finished`.
  The operator's THAT IS ALL is the SOLE close gate (PR-merge semantics — a comment
  before it means amend/abandon). There is NO separate "close it" step.
- Teardown division: the orchestrator owns tmux (`tools/architect-teardown.sh` —
  focus-return, then kill the `arch:<id>` pane found by TITLE); the housekeeper owns
  the git close, unchanged. The transcript-grep Stop hook, its jq race and the
  `/tmp/architect-close.log` leak are retired.
- Liveness: when a close is expected and the architect looks absent, the orchestrator
  inspects the pane directly (gone / pane_dead); the bus `orchid:status` probe is
  secondary; no scheduler. The broad [[bus-liveness]] framework stays deferred.
- Metadata ([[agent-metadata]] folded in): model + effort ride `orchid:status`
  (mutable), NOT identity — resolving Decision-018's open which-wins question: status
  is the live truth for mutable fields, identity the birth record. Token classes stay
  broken out; effort reads null until an env source exists.

## [2026-07-21 02:14 CEST] Decision-029: Duplicates fold into the older entry; rulings supersede the newer way
#merge #duplicates #supersession #board #tasks #decisions #dedup

Operator ruling (2026-07-21): the two relations get different merge models.

- DUPLICATE (the same thing filed twice — tasks, issues, board entries): the git
  model. The OLDER entry is the home; the newer one is struck as the duplicate and
  its content folds back into the older. Ids, edges and links keep resolving. A
  machine-generated stub with no unique history is deleted outright; a human-authored
  duplicate is cancel-struck on the board ("duplicate of [[x]]") so its trail
  survives. Any gh# badge the newer filing carried re-binds to the home.
- SUPERSESSION (a changed RULING): the newer wins — docs/decisions.md keeps its
  convention of striking the older heading with a "Superseded by" marker.

First execution: GitHub issue #23 folded into [[fleet-sidebar]] (da7cd2d).

## [2026-07-21 02:47 CEST] Decision-030: The gate vocabulary — operator words, and nothing else, trigger
#gates #vocabulary #signals #engage #makeitso #thatisall #cloud #close

Operator ruling (2026-07-21): the ritual words are THE signals — them, and their emoji
equivalents when in prose; nothing else triggers, and agents never self-emit a gate.
Actor-gated to the operator; unlimited amend rounds precede every gate.

- `ENGAGE` / ⚙ — kick-off: fires the prologue → plan hop (cloud: an issue comment;
  local: the operator's go to the orchestrator).
- `MAKE IT SO` / 🖖 — build gate: the architect may edit files from here, not before.
- `THAT IS ALL` — close approval (PR-merge semantics; a comment instead means
  amend/abandon — Decision-028).
- `ALL IT IS` — the architect's countersign; carried to the orchestrator as the bus
  `finished` signal (machinery, not an operator word).

Canonical prose documentation rides the unlanded f/cloud-architect branch (README,
ARCHITECTURE, the [[cloud-architect]] sidecar); this entry anchors the ruling in the
ledger meanwhile, per the operator's "documented outside of code".

## [2026-07-21 02:47 CEST] Decision-031: Automode by default; #madmax unrestricts a task's launches
#permissions #automode #classifier #madmax #launch #spawn #settings #housekeeper

Operator rulings (2026-07-21), after a close was repeatedly stalled by permission-
classifier denials (housekeeper dispatch, pushes, even a read-only grep):

- Sessions in these repos default to AUTO permission mode: `permissions.defaultMode`
  = "auto" in the shared settings.json — spawned agents (architects, housekeepers,
  headless sub-jobs) included. Friction is the exception, not the baseline.
- `#madmax` is a BOARD TAG (trailing the task line, like an edge): a tagged task runs
  unrestricted — every `claude` launch for that feature appends
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Operator-set ONLY — and because anything published
  where an agent can read it will eventually be used (operator, same night), the
  prohibition is STRUCTURAL, not prose: before honouring the tag, the launcher
  verifies it reached the board in an operator-authored commit (git provenance), not
  merely that it is present. Definition: AGENTS.files.md §TODO; spawn wiring:
  agents/orchestrator.md.
- The housekeeper's effort rises low → high and its charter gains a concurrent-streams
  briefing (main moves mid-close; stale branch context ≠ reverts) after a live misread.

## [2026-07-21 03:28 CEST] Decision-032: One orchestrator per repository; its session name is the repository
#orchestrator #sessions #naming #singleton #resume #zombie

Operator ruling (2026-07-21), amending the session-naming contract mid-plan: session
names name SESSIONS, and the orchestrator is not a workstream — it orchestrates them.
Exactly ONE orchestrator session exists per repository; its claude session name is the
repository name alone (`orchids`), never the `<repo> / <human name>` slash-form,
which belongs to workstream sessions (architects, ripeners). Summoning is resuming:
`claude --resume` by the bare repo name reaches THE orchestrator — a second one is
never started (the [[zombie-revival]] path revives the same single session). Typing a
repository's name therefore always lands on its orchestrator.

## [2026-07-21 03:30 CEST] Decision-033: Batch the pushes — a push is a workload trigger, not a save
#push #github #workflows #tokens #batching #cloud #comments

Operator MUST (2026-07-21): while discussing or refining anything, do NOT push on
every change. origin is wired to workflows (cloud hops, watchers) — every push
triggers workloads and spends tokens downstream. Commit locally as work lands; push
ONCE when the refinement round settles, or when the push itself is the intended
signal (a watcher waiting on state). Issue/PR comments are the same trigger class:
consolidate a round into one comment rather than dribbling triggers.

## [2026-07-21 05:38 CEST] Decision-034: Changelog and README — content staged at the source, file written at the hub
#changelog #readme #close #ownership #architect #orchestrator #injection-integrity #staging

Operator ruling (2026-07-21), settling [[readme-changelog-ownership]] (gh#31): the
objection to hub authorship is information loss — the finesse of WHY a change was
made the way it was lives in the architect's context and dies in a retelling, the
same loss injection-integrity names. The settlement extends the pattern that
already works for decisions: STAGE at the source, PROMOTE intact at the hub.

- The ARCHITECT authors the CONTENT while context is hot — the changelog entry in
  its own words and the user-facing README delta — as staged blocks in its sidecar
  result. It no longer edits CHANGELOG.md or README.md.
- The ORCHESTRATOR authors the FILE at ingest — places the staged entry under the
  canonical format, merges parallel features without collision (post-squash, on
  main), applies readme-sync judgement, holds the operator gate on the entry.
  Placement and format only: the entry lands in the architect's words or not at
  all.
- The HOUSEKEEPER stays verify-only (Decision-023's clause stands; its presence
  checks move to the staged blocks). ARCHITECTURE.md stays architect-authored
  on-branch for now — structural content is feature-scoped; revisit if its
  collision rate says otherwise.

## [2026-07-21 06:18 CEST] Decision-035: One tag vocabulary, board and GitHub — labels are the projection
#tags #labels #github #board #vocabulary #urgency #area #emoji

Operator rulings (2026-07-21), settling [[tags-and-labels]]:

- Board tags and GitHub labels are ONE system: the vocabulary lives in
  AGENTS.files.md §TODO (single source), `board_gh.py` mirrors it, and every
  issue's label set is REPLACED from its board line at each push. Projection-only:
  the board stays canonical; label edits on GitHub are overwritten.
- Labels are emoji-FIRST, always ("⚙️ area/process", never "area/⚙️ process").
- Urgency simplified: `urgent` is KILLED — it is never urgent until it is
  critical; `low` renamed `nice-to-have` — closer to reality. Enum:
  critical · nice-to-have · idea (empty = normal). Former urgent lines demoted to
  normal; the operator re-raises individually.
- `component` renamed `area` everywhere; labels carry the `area/` prefix.
- Locality tags: ☁️ cloud (reporting — it WAS built in the cloud), 🛰️ analyzable
  (CAN go to the cloud), 🛋️ house-bound (local-only from inception).
- Progress labels derived, not stored: 📋 todo · 🚧 doing (stage=working) ·
  ✅ done (done|functional); ⛔ blocked derived from unresolved ⊘ edges.
- Multi-part features are a PARENT with sub-todos, one area per leaf; parent
  issues link their children ([[rules-tuning]] is the worked example).

## [2026-07-21 06:33 CEST] Decision-036: The tmux topology — window per architect; subagents hidden, peekable
#tmux #workflow #architect #orchestrator #panes #windows #topology #peek #subagents #handoff

Operator rulings settling [[tmux-topology]] (2026-07-21); supersedes Decision-006
(pane-beside) and carries its tags:

- SESSION per repository → WINDOW per architect (one per active feature). The
  architect is something the operator interacts with — never a side-by-side or
  horizontal split. Spawn uses `tmux new-window`; the pane keeps its `arch:<id>`
  title, so the title-based teardown (Decision-028) works unchanged — killing the
  window's last pane closes the window and focus returns to the orchestrator.
- SUBAGENTS (builders, prep, sidecars) are hidden by default — never named
  sessions, surfaced in the sidebar via the bus — but hidden does NOT mean
  unpeekable: a PEEK opens a disposable pane tailing the subagent's live
  transcript, on demand, and closes when done.
- Peeks (and any deliberately visible subagent) live in a dedicated RIGHT COLUMN
  of the architect's window, stacked vertically, capped — never appended below
  the architect (the unusable default `split-window -v`). The cap is a
  build-time knob.

## [2026-07-21 08:43 CEST] Decision-037: The cloud path is canon — runtime, gates, handoff, and its work log
#cloud #gates #vocabulary #oauth #actions #handoff #badge #context #worklog #close-spine #app

> Close-spine ruleset clause superseded by Decision-040 (ruleset deleted; approach dropped).

Promoted from the cloud-architect stream (operator rulings, 2026-07-20/21):

- Runtime: hand-rolled headless CLI workflows (`claude -p --agent <role>` in
  GitHub Actions), NOT the official claude-code-action — full control of role
  charters and gates, matching the local spine. Auth: the subscription OAuth
  token (`claude setup-token` → repo secret), not a metered API key.
- Gate vocabulary amended (extends Decision-030): `MAKE IT SO` also accepts 🖖;
  `THAT IS ALL` also accepts 🚪. Gates are EXACT-form: the comment must BE the
  gate token, trimmed — a quoting comment never fires a hop. Actor-gated.
- ENGAGE does not bypass the orchestrator: hop 1 runs a cloud-orchestrator
  prologue (board handoff, sidecar ripeness) before any architect. Handoff badge
  contract: readiness stage → working ONLY; status stays todo; gh# inviolable;
  delegated-to lives in an issue comment.
- Context economy: the SIDECAR is canonical after each fold; hops read sidecar +
  gate comment, not the thread; every hop's last act writes handoff state back.
- Cloud work log rides the Actions cache (relay, not archive; housekeeper
  ingests before merge) — runners share no .git/the-works.
- close-spine: the status check IS a closing role's published judgment — setting
  it without a passed close gate is forgery. Org prerequisites documented in the
  workflow header ("Allow Actions to create PRs" ON). The ruleset is DISABLED
  until the named kaukea GitHub App exists (the built-in Actions identity cannot
  be bypass-listed) — re-enabling rides the app follow-up.

## [2026-07-21 12:39 CEST] Decision-038: Operator actions surface as end-of-reply bullets
#tone #operator #output #actions

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21 — issued in the app-identifying architect session,
confirmed directly to the orchestrator): actions expected FROM the operator must
never be buried in long descriptions. Every agent collects them as concise
bullet points at the END of the interaction, with clear indicators/links
(paths, URLs, exact commands). Encoded in `AGENTS.shared.md` §Tone.

## [2026-07-21 13:39 CEST] Decision-039: callabloom[bot] — one named identity for every cloud action
#app #cloud #identity #actions #secrets #callabloom

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21, app-identifying session): every GitHub action a
cloud hop takes — comment, commit, push, PR, merge — is performed as
**callabloom[bot]**, a kaukea-owned GitHub App (App ID 4354752), never as the
operator and never as the anonymous built-in `github-actions` actor. The token
is minted per hop via `actions/create-github-app-token@v3` from kaukea ORG
secrets `CALLABLOOM_APP_ID` / `CALLABLOOM_PRIVATE_KEY` (visibility all), with a
`github.token` fallback where the secrets are absent. The app is NOT a bypass
actor. Anthropic Routines cannot own a bot identity (they act as the user's
account) — at most an NL-trigger layer, never the identity substrate.

## [2026-07-21 13:39 CEST] Decision-040: Branch protection respawns as code; the ruleset contraption is dead
#close-spine #app #branch-protection #ordering #ruleset

Rulings (operator, 2026-07-21, live in the app-identifying session):

- The close-spine ruleset approach is DROPPED: ruleset 19333120 no longer
  exists (deleted, not disabled), org-level rulesets need a GitHub Team plan
  (kaukea is Free), and the status-check/bypass-actor contraption is retired.
  Supersedes Decision-037's close-spine ruleset clause (marker added there).
- Branch protection becomes its own task: formalise the workflow's EXISTING
  close rules as code — operator/code-owner approval required to merge `main`,
  callabloom excepted.
- Deterministic merge ordering is a THIRD concern ("Mr. Rabbit": a merge queue
  or optimistic-retry), a peer of the housekeeper and the orchestrator — merge
  order == changelog order. Spun out to its own task.

## [2026-07-21 13:52 CEST] Decision-041: Agents clean up after themselves — self-teardown at close
#close #teardown #bus #sub-agents #lifecycle #panes

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): closes were getting stuck on lingering children —
buses that never return, panes and sessions nobody kills — leaving flows
unfinishable. Enforcement is CHARTER TEXT ONLY (no verification apparatus, no
reaper pass):

- A bus ends in exactly two ways: RELEASED by its parent at close (`bus.py
  depart`, then it returns — its release IS its return), or ORPHANED (its inbox
  watch shows the parent's inbox gone → parent dead → it ends silently).
  "Never return" holds only while the parent lives.
- The CLOSING AGENT kills itself: the architect's last act after `ALL IT IS` +
  `finished` is releasing its bus and running `architect-teardown.sh` on its own
  pane. The orchestrator only dispatches the housekeeper; it runs the teardown
  solely as a fallback when an agent died before its self-teardown. Every role
  session releases its own bus before retiring.
- The end-of-task guard counts a released bus as returned.

## [2026-07-21 14:46 CEST] Decision-042: Cloud agents run operator-absent or on request — never auto-launched
#cloud #cloud-architect #orchestrator #dispatch #launch #authorization

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): the cloud agents are EXPERIMENTAL and missing
features. They exist for exactly two circumstances: runs while no operator is
present, and runs the operator explicitly requests. Under no circumstance does
the orchestrator decide on its own to launch a cloud agent — every cloud
launch requires the operator's explicit authorization. While the operator is
present, the local architect path is the default.

## [2026-07-21 19:42 CEST] Decision-043: ~~Fleet sidebar aggregates via an explicit repolist — Orchard's discovery deferred~~ *superseded by Decision-061*
#fleet-sidebar #sidebar #cross-repo #repolist #orchard #discovery #supersession

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): the fleet sidebar aggregates cross-repo via an
EXPLICIT repolist config (`~/.config/orchids/sidebar-repos`, one path per line,
or `ORCHIDS_SIDEBAR_REPOS`) — not scan-root, not fleet auto-discovery. This
deliberately defers the fleet-wide repo-discovery decision to Orchard
(`orchard-view` / `cross-repo-bus` carry it).

## [2026-07-21 19:42 CEST] Decision-044: Activity label is the only new bus surface; waiting/flash is derived
#fleet-sidebar #bus #activity #broadcast #flash #subagents

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): the sidebar's live state rides the EXISTING bus
as ordinary dynamic messages — `orchid:activity:<text>` and
`orchid:subagent:start|done:<label>`; no bus mechanism change. The activity
LABEL is the only new surface. Waiting/flash is DERIVED (notify_user OR
lifecycle blocked) — no new bus field for it. Activity is emitted as WORDING
by full agents (orchestrator/architect/ripener); subagents are shown by
name+spinner surfaced by their parent; the bus sidecar is omitted from rows.

## [2026-07-21 19:42 CEST] Decision-045: Tmux window names carry the session-naming display forms
#session-naming #tmux #window-naming #spawn #teardown

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): tmux WINDOW NAMES are the session-naming
display forms — orchestrator window = bare repo (`orchids`), architect window
= `<repo> ▸ <human>` (`orchids ▸ fleet sidebar`). NO `claude`, NO visible
`arch:<id>`. `arch:<id>` survives ONLY as the pane TITLE (teardown/reaping
handle). Nav matches the friendly window names. Baked into the spawn recipes
on the fleet-sidebar branch; completes the window-name half of session-naming
(gh#34, which had done only `claude --name`). Context: an earlier silent
`orch:<project>` rename was reverted — operator-visible naming is a SPEC
decision, never a silent HOW.

## [2026-07-21 19:42 CEST] Decision-046: A bus exits only when woken by an inbound message
#bus #monitor #teardown #agent-closing #wake

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): a bus sidecar blocked on its monitor exits
ONLY by being WOKEN — an inbound message arrives, the bus tears down its own
monitor and exits. Never kill a bus's monitor externally: the bus never wakes
and hangs forever. Closes therefore wake actively rather than wait passively;
long passive watch timeouts (15m) are unacceptable for exits. Refines
Decision-041 (release is the bus's return): release must reach the bus AS a
wake.

## [2026-07-21 20:48 CEST] Decision-047: Operator approvals relay over the bus as a sanctioned operator-origin class
#bus #approval #gates #operator-relay #architect #done-gate #agent-closing

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): an operator approval given outside the
architect's own window (typically in the orchestrator pane) reaches the
architect via a SANCTIONED OPERATOR RELAY — a distinct operator-origin
message class on the bus that gate-waiting agents accept as the operator's
word. The relaying agent forwards the approval verbatim and flagged as
operator-origin, never as its own peer traffic; ordinary peer messages remain
rejected at gates. This closes the silent stall found at the fleet-sidebar
close, where an approval typed in the orchestrator pane had no path to the
architect's done gate. Chosen over the alternatives of charter-only
redirection ("type it in the architect's window") and tmux keystroke
injection. Mechanics land with the agent-closing corrective.

## [2026-07-21 21:59 CEST] Decision-048: Teardown, reaping and mount key off the @arch_id window user-option
#teardown #panes #close #agent-closing #arch-id #tmux #reaping #sidebar

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21, via the agent-closing corrective): the stable
handle for an architect window is a tmux WINDOW user-option `@arch_id=<id>`,
set at launch. `architect-teardown.sh` and orchestrator reaping resolve the
window by `@arch_id` and close at WINDOW granularity — the mounted sidebar
pane dies with it. The `arch:<id>` pane title survives only as a
non-load-bearing human hint: claude clobbers pane titles live with the
session name, which is exactly what broke title-keyed teardown and reaping.
`@arch_id` is also the contract sidebar-fixes consumes for mount idempotency.
Refines Decisions 028/036/045 (which had made the pane title the handle).

## [2026-07-21 21:59 CEST] Decision-049: The operator-origin relay stays literal — spoofability is an accepted trade-off
#bus #approval #operator-relay #security #trust-model #agent-closing

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-21): the operator-origin relay is implemented
LITERALLY per Decision-047 — any `operator_origin`-flagged message is honored
at a gate; no conductor-only hardening. The flag is convention, not
cryptography: on a cooperative single-operator fleet where NO bus message is
authenticated, the spoofable-bypass finding raised by the security scan is an
ACCEPTED, operator-sanctioned trade-off. Peer prose without the flag still
never closes a gate.

## [2026-07-22 12:15 CEST] Decision-050: The bloom vocabulary, and a mandatory bloom round at every handoff
#bloom #bloomer #vocabulary #rename #handoff #what-bar #scope #bloom-tasks

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-22): the ripen word family is retired and replaced
by **bloom/bloomer** — tasks bloom until pickable; the prep agent is the
bloomer; the skill is `bloom-tasks` (verb-object convention). Supersedes the
word choice of Decision-026 (groom→ripen); executes the retirement task
(gh#27). Renames ship with migration `2026-07-22-bloom-tasks-rename.md`; the
bloom commit template becomes `🌸 bloom: <id> → <stage>`; the swept-SHA state
file becomes `.claude/state/last-bloom.sha`.

Second ruling in the same order: the bloomer runs **at EVERY handoff** as a
mandatory pre-launch bloom round — part of the WHAT definition, before the
architect gets involved. On an operator go, the orchestrator dispatches the
bloomer on the picked task FIRST (step 0 of the handoff); it closes the WHAT
with the targeted functional-completeness questions of Decision-027, and no
architect is spawned until the round returns and its Questions are answered.
A `plan-ready` badge does not skip the round — it confirms the WHAT is
current at launch, not merely present. Launches themselves stay
operator-gated; Decision-027's autonomous kick-off remains gated off.

## [2026-07-22 13:19 CEST] Decision-051: The bus sidecar is a singleton — per AGENT, by design
#bus #singleton #message-bus #architecture #ruling

Ruling (operator, 2026-07-22): the message-bus sidecar is a singleton PER
AGENT — every agent loads EXACTLY ONE bus, never more, and it is not up for
conversation. The per-agent architecture (Decision-041's one-sidecar-per-
agent) IS the design; the defect the operator observed is multiplicity
BEYOND one-per-agent: duplicate bus spawns within a session (one occurred
in the 2026-07-22 orchestrator session) and stale bus rows surviving their
agent. Corrective boarded as bus-singleton (enforce the one-per-agent
invariant, reap strays); the sidebar renders exactly one bus row per live
agent (sidebar-polish item 5).
[Corrected 13:2x CEST same day: the initial recording misstated the ruling
as one-bus-per-REPOSITORY — a transcription error by the orchestrator,
fixed on the operator's immediate clarification.]

## [2026-07-22 13:52 CEST] Decision-052: Sidebar rulings from the sidebar-fixes corrective
#sidebar #panes #idempotency #status #flash #close #sidebar-fixes

Three rulings made with the operator during the sidebar-fixes build
(archive/sidebar-fixes, squash de71b80), promoted at ingest:
1. Sidebar mount idempotency detects the sidebar PANE by its
   pane_start_command (running sidebar.py) — self-contained, deliberately
   NOT consuming the @arch_id window-identity handle of Decision-048: pane
   presence and window identity are orthogonal concerns.
2. A repository with no live orchestrator session renders a distinct IDLE
   status (⚪, dim) — idle is a real state, never conflated with running.
3. A terminal lifecycle signal (finished/abandoned) clears the
   operator-waiting flash; otherwise only a new activity broadcast changes
   it — a resolved session must never keep flashing "waiting".

## [2026-07-22 15:55 CEST] Decision-053: Field projection targets GitHub's native surfaces; Urgency stays alongside
#board #github #sync #fields #priority #type #dependencies #field-projecting

The field-projecting build's frozen plan, agreed with the operator
2026-07-22 and promoted at ingest (the branch had recorded it under the
number 051, which main had already assigned to the bus-singleton ruling —
renumbered here):
- **Type** → GitHub's native Issue Type (`updateIssueIssueType`); the three
  missing org types (Refactor, Housekeeping, Completion) are created
  org-wide, ensure-if-missing. The emoji type labels (Decision-035) stay.
- **Priority** → the native org Issue Field "Priority", mapped from badge
  urgency: critical→Urgent, empty/normal→Medium, nice-to-have→Low,
  idea→Low (High unused). The Projects-v2 "Urgency" custom field is KEPT
  and still written — operator ruling: both live side by side.
- **Relationships** → board `⊘` edges become native Issue Dependencies
  (addBlockedBy/removeBlockedBy), fully reconciled each push; `blocking`
  is GitHub's derived inverse. `~related` has NO native equivalent
  (schema-introspected) and projects as a `### Related` body-link list.
- Board is canonical; the sync writes GitHub, never the reverse, on these
  surfaces.

## [2026-07-22 16:16 CEST] Decision-054: The close composes on a staging ref; the ingest folds into the squash
#close #housekeeper #squash #staging #ingest #atomicity #git

Operator design (2026-07-22), replacing the serialized two-writer close:
the housekeeper composes the squash on a `close/<id>` staging branch —
where amending is free and leaves no public trace — folds the
orchestrator's pre-drafted ingest (`.git/the-works/close-<id>.draft/`)
into the SAME commit, and lands main by fast-forward (cherry-pick when
main moved; same content, equally clean). One atomic commit carries the
feature and its board/decision state, so main never shows merged code
against a stale board. Telemetry notes attach only after the final SHA
exists. The housekeeper also dispatches AT the gate word, in parallel with
the architect's self-teardown, retrying only the worktree removal until
the architect's session dies. The genuinely serialized core of a close is
now a single ref update.

## [2026-07-22 16:18 CEST] Decision-055: The ingest is staged rolling by the builder side and folded mechanically
#close #ingest #staging #architect #housekeeper #decisions #numbering #scribe

Operator design (2026-07-22), refining Decision-054's atomic close — nobody
re-reads with cold context what was known hot, and nothing waits for the end:
- The ARCHITECT stages the ingest AS THE BUILD PROGRESSES — decision entries
  (in final format, UNNUMBERED: `Decision-NNN`), the changelog block, the
  result — updated at every landed step, inline or via a small scribe
  subagent aggregating one commit at a time. A close-time catch-up is the
  named anti-pattern.
- The HOUSEKEEPER folds the staged blocks into the squash mechanically:
  decision numbers assigned from the live file's tail at fold time (branch-
  assigned numbers collide, live-fired twice on 2026-07-22), and the
  feature's own board badge flipped as part of the fold — the one board edit
  a child may make, as close execution.
- The ORCHESTRATOR no longer pre-drafts what was staged; its close work is
  the operator-gated CHANGELOG placement, cross-feature promotions and
  corrections, stream archiving, convergence, one push.

## [2026-07-22 16:22 CEST] Decision-056: Aggregation belongs to the context that already holds the tokens
#economy #tokens #staging #builder #architect #scribe #principle

Operator principle (2026-07-22), general and durable: a work product is
staged by the agent whose context ALREADY contains its inputs — the builder
that made the commit writes the ingest increment in its typed return; the
architect folds increments as they arrive (the return enters its context
regardless). Separate readers are the anti-pattern: a scribe subagent
re-reading commits, or anyone reconstructing from `git log` at close, pays
input tokens to re-load what the committing context had for free. The
scribe variant of Decision-055 is retired before first use. Same family as
the popup ruling (a script where no judgment is needed): spend model
attention exactly once, where the information is born.

## [2026-07-22 17:26 CEST] Decision-057: The operator's build-gate phrase, translated at the boundary
#gates #keywords #relay #ui #operator #make-it-so

Operator ruling (2026-07-22): the operator-facing build-gate phrase becomes
**"NO NO THAT WAS NOT A QUESTION"** (variants: THIS for THAT; short form
"NO NO") — the architect's final plan summary is answered by objecting that
it needed asking at all. Implementation is a TRANSLATION AT THE UI
BOUNDARY, per the operator's scope guidance: every operator-input surface
(orchestrator pane relay now; the question/gate popup when it lands) maps
the phrase to the fleet's INTERNAL protocol string `MAKE IT SO`, which is
unchanged everywhere else — defs, bus matching, in-flight builds. A
directly-typed `MAKE IT SO` still works. `THAT IS ALL` is untouched.

## [2026-07-22, addendum to Decision-057] ENGAGE joins the build-gate phrases
#gates #keywords #engage

Operator addendum, minutes after Decision-057: **`ENGAGE`** is also an
accepted operator build-gate phrase, translated at the same boundary to the
internal `MAKE IT SO`. The accepted set is now: the full NO-NO phrase
(THAT/THIS), `NO NO`, `ENGAGE`, and the internal string itself.

## [2026-07-22, second addendum to Decision-057] The glacial-pace phrase joins the set
#gates #keywords

"BY ALL MEANS, MOVE AT A GLACIAL PACE" is the third operator build-gate
phrase — approval by sarcasm, completing the operator's dictation
("complement ENGAGE with…"). Same boundary translation to `MAKE IT SO`.
Accepted set: the NO-NO phrase (THAT/THIS) · NO NO · ENGAGE · the
glacial-pace phrase · the internal string itself.

## [2026-07-22, third addendum to Decision-057] The corrected keyword table; ENGAGE is cloud-only
#gates #keywords #engage #cloud

Operator correction, same day: ENGAGE is a SEPARATE keyword reserved for the
CLOUD path — the explicit authorization word for dispatching a cloud run
(Decision-042); it is not a build-gate synonym and never starts local
coding. The corrected table: coding START = internal MAKE IT SO, operator
phrases "NO NO THAT WAS NOT A QUESTION" (THIS/THAT; simply "THAT WAS NOT A
QUESTION"; "NO NO") and "BY ALL MEANS, MOVE AT A GLACIAL PACE" (simply
"MOVE AT A GLACIAL PACE"). Coding END = THAT IS ALL, unchanged, no
synonyms. Keywords to become configurable in a future task.

## [2026-07-22 17:45 CEST] Decision-058: The sidebar status vocabulary is six static states
#sidebar #status #vocabulary #sidebar-polish

From the sidebar-polish build (operator, direct): six distinct static
states — working / waiting / idle / awaiting-another-agent / done /
failed — done and failed never sharing a glyph, idle distinct from
awaiting. Supersedes the "three live plus one parked" draft of the
original item 9. No animation anywhere (item 1).

## [2026-07-22 17:45 CEST] Decision-059: Human names are authored at intake, never grammar-converted at runtime
#naming #titles #board #sidebar-polish

From the sidebar-polish build (operator, direct): the declarative human
name (imperative-vs-declarative, session-naming contract) is AUTHORED when
the ledger entry is created — the board's short title / sidecar H1 — and
every title call site reads that; mechanical hyphen-replace survives only
pre-intake. No runtime grammar-conversion code exists.

## [2026-07-22 17:45 CEST] Decision-060: Agent self-exit lifecycle — two closing messages, a declared grace, then the orchestrator kills
#lifecycle #close #sidebar #reaping #sidebar-polish

From the sidebar-polish build (operator, direct), the real fix for stale
sidebar rows: agents END via a lifecycle contract — two closing messages
and a declared grace period (default 10s); past the window the
orchestrator kills the process and broadcasts the death. Distinct from
bus-singleton (which reaps stray bus sidecars, not whole agents).

## [2026-07-22 17:45 CEST] Decision-061: Decision-043 superseded — the sidebar discovers repos via the registry
#sidebar #orchard #registry #supersession

Decision-043's explicit repolist (Orchard discovery deferred) is
SUPERSEDED by the sidebar-polish item-7 build: repos appear via the
`.ai.toml`-triggered registry automatically, hidden conversationally,
persisted across remounts.
